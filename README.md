# Auto Layout Tests

This project is a comparison of Auto Layout, as discussed at the beginning of [episode 32 of Mobile Couch](http://mobilecouch.co/32). It contains two implementations of a view from [Multiplex for iOS](http://www.multiplexcomic.com/app); the first utilises Auto Layout, and the second uses manual calculations (which is used in the production version of the app).

This project was created by Daniel "Jelly" Farrelly ([@jellybeansoup](https://twitter.com/jellybeansoup)) and [Jake MacMullin](https://github.com/jmacmullin) ([@jmacmullin](https://twitter.com/jmacmullin)). To hear more about it, and the experimentation behind it, listen to the first half of [Mobile Couch #32](http://mobilecouch.co/32).
